grapher-scratchwork
===================

This is a very primitive function plotting program that is not meant for any serious work, that was written very quickly and crudely, but which I might work on improving. If you are looking for a Plotter in racket that is fully featured, you can look up PLoT, which is a plotter available with the Racket programming language.  I basically wrote this plotter for fun, and any improvements to that end will be to that end also.
